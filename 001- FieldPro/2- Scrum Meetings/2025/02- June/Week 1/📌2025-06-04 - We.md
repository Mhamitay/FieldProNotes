- I did the initial required backend work for Offline Completions. 2986
- I Tested item 2 from item # 3214 [Bug 3214* Dans Bugs](https://dev.azure.com/FieldPro-Software/Web%20Application/_workitems/edit/3214) I updated the work item.
	- Both **Ticket Total** and **Avg. Quote Total** are not removed when unselected from the Column chooser 
	- **Downhole Location** is listed twice
- for 3205 Grid/List, I Updated all the APIs to use the force500 and the grid/list message, on branch  - [MH-Jun25-DevExpressGridAPISupport].
- Tested Xero after the deployment on PRAMA tenant and it looked good to me.

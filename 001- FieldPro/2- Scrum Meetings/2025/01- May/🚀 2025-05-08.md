1- 🛠️ Fixed work item #3143 Migration - Phone Number - Better error message
when Moosa finished the frontend, I did test it gain.
while i was testing that, I found an offline issue on resources contact, that is when remove the phone number and save, it still saves the phoneNumber. I let Moosa know and he fixed that [Task 3146 Offline Adding new contact issue with the phone number](https://dev.azure.com/FieldPro-Software/Web%20Application/_workitems/edit/3146/)

> [!example] Notes  
My browser seems to be holding on old files that why it was behaving differently. me and Moosa took quite a bit of time Debugging that.  but once we used new profile it seems that the javascripts and files are updated and it was working properly.

3-  🧪 Test work item [Task 3142 Offline - Fleet - Populate Loadout by Fleet](https://dev.azure.com/FieldPro-Software/Web%20Application/_workitems/edit/3142/) Offline populating loadout items when fleet unit is added. Good

3- 🧪 the DevExpress Reports, check Fleet, Field Users report, there was not filter when you selected a user. Good.

4- 🔍Looked into 3149 Quote and Ticket are not populating the Discount % with Moosa, Was frontend issue and was handled by Moosa.

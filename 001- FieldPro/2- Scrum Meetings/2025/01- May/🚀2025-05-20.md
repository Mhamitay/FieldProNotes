Fixed, 3175 - Item 5 -  Saving Job as "Metric" from completions workflow isn't working in south.  Verify front end is sending in "Metric" and if they are then verify backend is saving it/not saving it. 

Looked into 3175 - Item 7 - Revision Control based on "approved" and "checker" being assigned.  This might be backend.  there were no problem a pone test by Aaron

Troubleshooting for 3180 coding not saving. took sometime due me not knowing how it should work. but it turn out it was a frontend issue.

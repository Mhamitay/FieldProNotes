Today I will start by going through my work item  and testing staging for north.
and then i need to review the work item 3258 is been a while since i looked at it. and give it a one more try.

Started by Testing Wrok items on staging.

Was a good day.  Started by troubleshooting the duplicate job numbers on the job grid. 
then moved to test my (**North**) work items. make sure they are okay. Now

I am reviewing my **South** work items to make sure that the south specific items are okay before the next Deploy.
